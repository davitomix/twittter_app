# Twitter Clone App

A Twitter wannabe app: Some of the core features of the platform – users, profiles, “friending”, posts, news feed, and “liking” . We’ll also implement sign-in with the real Twitter by using Devise.

## Built With

- Ruby,
- Ruby on Rails,
- Html, CSS and JS

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
